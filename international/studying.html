<h2>Introduction to Anki</h2>
<p>
    Anki is a app for desktop and android that is great for reviewing large amount of information, such as <b>language vocabulary</b>, on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
    The app relies on the principle of spaced repetion, which means that the daily interval for reviews are calculated by the app based on how well you remeber a piece of information. 
    That means that information you remember easily will be shown to you less frequent than information you forget easily.
</p>
<h2>How to use Anki</h2>
<p>
    First you decide how many new cards you want to learn per day, then on subsequent days, Anki will show you both new cards and some of the cards from previous days for you to review.
</p>
<p>    
    Its reccomended to keep the daliy amount of new cards at a low value (10 per day) for atleast a week before you decide to increase the amount of new cards since the most important part about Anki, is that you review your cards <b>every single day</b>.
    By reviewing every single day you can have alot of learned cards in your deck, but only spend a small amount of time to review every day.
</p>
<p>
    <b>For example:</b> The A1 & A2 deck has about 2000 words in it with 2 cards each, one for translating the word and one for pronounicng the word. Thats's about 4000 cards. 
    If you spend 20 min a day learning 20 new cards a day, you will complete the whole deck in 200 days.
