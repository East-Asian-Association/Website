<h2>Conversation Corner</h2>
<h3>What is CC?</h3>
<p>
The association regularly hosts language exchange events, 
referred to as conversation corners, that promote language and 
cultural exchange between all students that have interests 
connected to East Asia. CC is the commonly used abbreviation for this event.
</p>

<p>
CC has evolved as an event during the years of this association. 
Currently we arrange a language caf√©, where we offer the languages: 
Swedish, English, Korean, Mandarin and Japanese.

Tuesdays and Thursdays between <b class="red"> 17:15 - 19:00</b> in the C-building 
at Campus Valla.

<h3>Cooking events and Special CC</h3>
<p>
As language and culture are strongly connected, sometimes we host cultural activities, such as cooking events, 
Swedish barbeques, Calligraphy or Karaoke, just to name a few. 
If you are interested in when these special events occur please make sure to follow us on social media where we send out more information!
