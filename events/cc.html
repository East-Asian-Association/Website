<h1>Conversation Corner</h1>
<p>
The association regularly hosts language exchange events, 
referred to as conversation corners, that promote language and 
cultural exchange between all students that have interests 
connected to East Asia. <b>CC</b> is the commonly used abbreviation for this event.
</p>

<p>
CC has evolved as an event during the years of this association. 
Currently we arrange a language caf√©, where we offer the languages: 
Swedish, English, Korean, Mandarin and Japanese. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Free fika</b> is served for all our members the whole year during CC. 
Read about membership <b><a href='/about?article=membership'>here</a></b>.  We arrange CC twice a week on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays between 17:15 and 19:00 in the C-building 
at Campus Valla.

<h2>Cooking events and Special CC</h2>
<p>
As language and culture are strongly connected, sometimes we host cultural activities, such as cooking events, 
Swedish barbeques, Calligraphy or Karaoke, just to name a few. 
If you are interested in when these special events occur please make sure to follow us on social media where we send out more information!
