<h1>Student Pub</h1>
<p>
EAA also arranges student pubs where our members can access <b>very cheap food</b> together with good drinks. 
Usually we serve East Asian or Swedish dishes. This is also a big part of the Swedish student life 
and our pubs are located in “Gasquen”, in the bottom floor of the Kårallen-building at Campus Valla.
