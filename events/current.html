        Celebrating christmas eve with a christmas dinner (or "Julbord" as we call it  in Sweden) is a longstanding Swedish tradition. There are many Swedish foods exclusivly eaten during christmas that are hard to experience in other settings.

        In addition of getting to experience Swedish food culuture, it is great a oportunity for our international members to share traditional food from their home countries as we encourage all our members to bring home made food to this event!
