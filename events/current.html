        Celebrating christmas eve with a christmas dinner (or "Julbord" as we call it  in Sweden) is a longstanding Swedish tradition. There are many Swedish foods exclusivly eaten during christmas, and it's a tradiation many swedes hold very dearly.

        In addition to experiencing swedish food culuture, this is great a oportunity for our international members to share traditional food from their home countries as it is costumary for all our members to bring their own food to the event!
