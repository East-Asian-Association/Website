          <h1>Events</h1>
      
          <h2><b>Conversation Corner</b></h2>
          <p>
          The association regularly hosts language exchange events, 
          referred to as conversation corners, that promote language and 
          cultural exchange between all students that have interests 
          connected to East Asia. <b>CC</b> is the commonly used abbreviation for this event.
          </p>

          <p>
          CC has evolved as an event during the years of this association. 
          Currently we arrange a language café, where we offer the languages: 
          Swedish, English, Korean, Mandarin and Japanese. 
          </p>

          <p>
          <b>Free fika</b> is served for all our members the whole year during CC. 
          Read about membership <b><a href='../Membership'>here</a></b>.  We arrange CC twice a week on 
          Tuesdays and Thursdays between 17:15 and 19:00 in the C-building 
          at Campus Valla.
          </p>

          <h2><b>Sittning (in Swedish)</b></h2>
          <p>
          “Sittning” is a common student event in Sweden. It is usually explained as dinner parties for university students. 
          In EAA we usually arrange two big dinner parties every year for our members. Usually “Sittning” comes with a theme. 
          “Sittning” is especially popular among our exchange student members where they can experience traditional Swedish student life.
          </p>
          <p>
          “Sittning” in Swedish is translated to “Sitting” in English. 
          </p>

          <h2><b>Student Pub</b></h2>
          <p>
          EAA also arranges student pubs where our members can access <b>very cheap food</b> together with good drinks. 
          Usually we serve East Asian or Swedish dishes. This is also a big part of the Swedish student life 
          and our pubs are located in “Gasquen”, in the bottom floor of the Kårallen-building at Campus Valla. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Disclaimer: <b>Karaoke</b> may appear during our pubs.
          </p>

          <h2><b>Cooking events and Special CC</b></h2>
          <p>
          As language and culture are strongly connected, sometimes we host cultural activities, such as cooking events, 
          Swedish barbeques, Calligraphy or Karaoke, just to name a few. 
          If you are interested in when these special events occur please make sure to follow us on social media where we send out more information!
