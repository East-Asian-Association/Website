          <p>
            The East Asian Association, <span class="chinese">林雪平大學東亞協會</span>* 
            or EAA for short, is a student association at Linköping University founded the 28th of April 2009 as a collaboration by and for students interested in East Asia. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Today the association has around 200 members from all over the world, but primarily Sweden, Japan, China and Korea.
          </p>
          
          <p>        
            We host a lot of events every year where some of the events are typical Swedish student life events and others are more focused on language and cultural exchange. 
            We encourage everyone to join in these events and have as much fun as possible! If you are interested you can find more information under 
            Events.

            One of the main responsibilities for EAA is to host welcoming activities for new Swedish students coming to Linköping University to study Mandarin or Japanese combined with Engineering. 
            (Sadly there is currently no program for studying the Korean language at Linköping University, 
            but it is still a popular language among our members!)
